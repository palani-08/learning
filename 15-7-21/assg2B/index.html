              <h3>Fabulous Co-worker</h3>
              <p>Kalam took great care of his colleagues. A co-worker had  promised his kids that hewould take them to the science museum after returningfrom work, and obtained theprior permission of Mr. Kalam to leave early. Thecolleague was so engrossed in hiswork that it was well into the evening when he realisedthat he had made a promise tohis kids. On rushing back home, he came to know fromhis wife that Mr. Kalam hadcome earlier and taken his kids to the museum.</p><br><br>
              <h3>Great Human Being</h3>
              <p>We were in a convoy of 6-7 cars. Dr. Kalam and I werein the second car. Ahead us wasan open gypsy with three soldiers in it. Two of themwere sitting on either side and onelean guy was standing atop, holding his gun. One hourinto the road journey, Dr. Kalamsaid, "Why is he standing? He will get tired. Thisis like punishment. Can you ask awireless message to given that he may sit?" I hadto convince him, he has beenprobably instructed to keep standing for better security.He did not relent. We triedradio messaging, that did not work. For the next 1.5hours of the journey, he remindedme thrice to see if I can hand signal him to sit down.Finally, realizing there is little wecan do--he told me, "I want to meet him and thankhim".</p><br><br>
          <p>"Later, when we landed in IIM Shillong, I went inquiringthrough security people andgot hold of the standing guy. I took him inside andDr. Kalam greeted him. He shook hishand, said thank you buddy. "Are you tired? Wouldyou like something to eat? I amsorry you had to stand so long because of me". Theyoung lean guard, draped in blackcloth, was surprised at the treatment. He lost words,just said, "Sir, aapke liye to 6ghante bhi khade rahenge".</p>
